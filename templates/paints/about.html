    <p>My main priority with this project was to do something visually striking. Since I first learned CSS and HTML many years ago - all forgotten / more re-learned - I was intrigued about the gap that seemed to exist in my knowledge of how transition my 90's looking websites into something manufactured in the current era.</p>
    <p>Whilst struggling with the concept of dictionaries translated into objects some weeks ago I wanted to set-up a practice code for me to get my head around it. I decided a paint shop would be a simple enough concept to directly translate. Whilst barely any of that practice was used here, it did provide me with a colourful idea of what to do for my project.</p>
    <h4>Friday</h4>
    <p>My initial difficulty was in deciding how to break my project into MVP, extensions, advanced etc, and so much of the day was spent drawing, writing and researching. Looking back now I achieved most of what I set out to do. I had thought at first that the dynamic colouring of the website would be difficult, but actually after using an algorithm generated by chatGPT I was able to effectively re-arrange HEX codes.</p>
    <h4>Saturday</h4>
    <p>Saturday morning saw my first implementation of the dynamic colouring, albeit it wasn't properly implemented at this stage. After an afternoon walk I toiled with how to properly arrange the data of my paints, ie how would they respond to factors such as popularity? After an hour or two of speculating about how I'd create such a Python function I had a brainwave - use SQL.</p>
    <h4>Sunday</h4>
    <p>Despite being sensible on my night out on Satuday I was fairly lethargic on Sunday, spending most of the day attempting to implement CRUD. I also progressed my paint offsetter slightly in terms of implementation - espescially as regards inline styling - but my method of implementation in the backend wasn't the best and I felt it severely hampered my implementation of the update CRUD. After several hours in chatGPT hell I signed off, but not before coming up with a solution - albeit one I wasn't sure how to execute.</p>
    <h4>Monday</h4>
    <p>Thanks to the help of the instructors, my colleagues and occasionally using my brain I made great strides on Monday - so much so that I would attempt to jot down my learning reflections later that evening with a total of 7 bullet points! At this stage CRUD was fully implemented and my website had full functionality.</p>
    <h4>Tuesday</h4>
    <p>In the weeks prior I didn't do much CSS outside of the classes we did so I was looking forward to this. However in the morning I hadn't quite clocked that my cache was filling up and as such changes to the website weren't registering outside of a hard refresh. This led to an over-use of chatGPT in an attempt to solve my problems - it didn't. After Keith pointed me in the right direction I started to make better progress, but ultimately wasn't where I wanted to be. I coded into the evening but I found that I didn't have a full grasp of my website's design, having become over-relliant on AI.</p>
    <h4>Wednesday</h4>
    <p>I was generally feeling quite run-down so I decided to stay at home and use the extra hours to plough through things. I started to remember more tricks provided during our CSS learning, namely how to effectively use the inspect function to play around with elements on the page, and this led to far, far greater productivity - to the extent that I refactored nearly every aspect of the websites design</p>
    <h4>Reflections</h4>
    <p>Whilst proud of what I've done I did feel I should maybe have challenged myself more on a database level by looking to do a many-to-many comparison. I would have done this by having users and uses, the users having favourite paints, the paints having famous uses and the users enjoying some of these uses. If these factors lined up the users could become friends! The paints could also have values ascribed to them relative to their favourite users wealth, and perhaps users could only vote a number of times too.</p>
    <p>One area in which I consider my project to have largely failed is in regards to accessibility. The HTML isn't the neatest across the board and could certainly have done with more labelling. On the plus side there are descriptions of all the class attributes and a reasonable naming convention as regards classes, but this certainly could have been improved upon.</p>
    <p>Whilst I'm proud of the finished product the CSS file has 323 lines of code, and as such isn't very DRY-complicit. This is largely down to my problems in the beginning and lacking confidence of my structure - for reference, 2 rows, a column based structure in the second row - but in fairness each of my pages does things slightly differently and in the interests of muddling through I've given a reasonably clearish naming convention to my classes. Much to improve upon and refactor, but job done for now.</p>
